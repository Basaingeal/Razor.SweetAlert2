﻿# v1.0 Release! 🎉

All future releases will be following semantic versioning, so expect no breaking public API changes until v2.
This public API has remained largely unchanged for months now, so I'm confident nothing will need to break until either `sweetalert2@9.0.0`, a new .NET version, or an [issue](https://github.com/Basaingeal/Razor.SweetAlert2/issues) is submitted that suggests better/more inutitive functionality. The stable release of Blazor WebAssembly (in May 2020) could cause a breaking change. We'll see.

New (non-breaking) features from `sweetalert2` will be added in minor releases.

##### Currently utilizing `sweetalert2@8.17.6`

## Breaking Changes
* Bump `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` to `3.0.0`
* Bump `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web` to `3.0.0`
