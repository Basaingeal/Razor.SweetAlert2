# v4.3.1

## Dependencies

- bump `sweetalert2` to `10.10.1`
- bump `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` to `3.1.10`
- bump `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web` to `3.1.10`

*`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components` version `5.0.0` is now out. It only supports .NET 5, not .NET Standard 2.0. Upgrading would make this library only usable by .NET 5 applications. I will not be upgrading to `>= 5.0.0` unless there are new features added to the Blazor framework worth taking advantage of. In that case, the library would start targeting multiple frameworks in order to preserve functionality on pre .NET 5 applications.*
